## How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**  
   Upload any academic, research, or technical PDF using the web interface.

2. **Choose Podcast Style**  
   - **Full Podcast (All Details):** Converts your entire document into a detailed, conversational podcast.
   - **Highlights Podcast (Summary Only):** Generates a concise, summary-focused podcast episode.

3. **AI Script Generation**  
   - Uses **Google Gemini (Generative AI)** to analyze your document, summarize content (if needed), and create a natural back-and-forth script between "Nishant" (host) and "Megha" (expert guest).
   - For longer documents, splits content into chunks to ensure smooth, manageable podcast segments.

4. **Text-to-Speech Audio Creation**  
   - Each line of the script is converted to speech using realistic voices:
     - On **macOS**, uses the built-in `say` command for lifelike voices.
     - On **Windows/Linux**, uses [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) for cross-platform support.

5. **Download Podcast**  
   - All audio segments are combined into a single MP3.
   - Download and listen to your personalized podcast episode!

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishanttomar21/podify-my-paper.git
cd podify-my-paper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Set up API Key(s):

You'll need an API key for **Google Gemini (Generative AI)**.  
You can provide your API key in one of two ways:

- **Option 1:** Directly edit the code (replace `GEMINI_API_KEY = "Enter-your-api-key"` in `main.py` with your actual key).
- **Option 2:** Set the key as an environment variable in your terminal (recommended):

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```

*(On Windows use `set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`)*

### 2. Run the App

After installation and setting the API key, start the web app with:

```bash
python main.py
```
