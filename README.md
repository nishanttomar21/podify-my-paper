## üö¶ How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**  
   Upload any academic, research, or technical PDF using the web interface.

2. **Choose Podcast Style**  
   - **Full Podcast (All Details):** Converts your entire document into a detailed, conversational podcast.
   - **Highlights Podcast (Summary Only):** Generates a concise, summary-focused podcast episode.

3. **AI Script Generation**  
   - Uses **Google Gemini (Generative AI)** to analyze your document, summarize content (if needed), and create a natural back-and-forth script between "Nishant" (host) and "Megha" (expert guest).
   - For longer documents, splits content into chunks to ensure smooth, manageable podcast segments.

4. **Text-to-Speech Audio Creation**  
   - Each line of the script is converted to speech using realistic voices:
     - On **macOS**, uses the built-in `say` command for lifelike voices.
     - On **Windows/Linux**, uses [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) for cross-platform support.

5. **Download Podcast**  
   - All audio segments are combined into a single MP3.
   - Download and listen to your personalized podcast episode!
