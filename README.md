## How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**  
   Upload any academic, research, or technical PDF using the web interface.

2. **Choose Podcast Style**  
   - **Full Podcast (All Details):** Converts your entire document into a detailed, conversational podcast.
   - **Highlights Podcast (Summary Only):** Generates a concise, summary-focused podcast episode.

3. **AI Script Generation**  
   - Uses **Google Gemini (Generative AI)** to analyze your document, summarize content (if needed), and create a natural back-and-forth script between "Nishant" (host) and "Megha" (expert guest).
   - For longer documents, splits content into chunks to ensure smooth, manageable podcast segments.

4. **Text-to-Speech Audio Creation**  
Each line of the script is converted to speech using realistic voices. You can now choose between:

- **Murf AI TTS (multi-voice, cross-platform):**  
  The default, recommended option, with natural-sounding voices for both host and guest. No platform restrictions!

- **macOS Say Command (optional):**  
  For Mac users who want to use built-in lifelike voices.

- **gTTS (optional):**  
  For simple, single-voice cross-platform support.

> **Note:** Murf AI is now integrated and used by default for the best-quality, multi-speaker experience.

5. **Download Podcast**  
   - All audio segments are combined into a single MP3.
   - Download and listen to your personalized podcast episode!

- **Easy Web UI:** Built with Gradio for one-click useâ€”no code required for users.

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.8 or higher
- **Google Gemini API Key:** Required for AI podcast script and summarization. [Sign up here.](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- **Murf AI API Key:** Required for Murf TTS voice generation. [Get your Murf API key here.](https://murf.ai/)

**Audio Generation:**
- **Default:** Uses Murf AI for multi-voice TTS on all platforms.
- **macOS (optional):** Uses the built-in `say` command for lifelike podcast voices.
- **Windows/Linux (optional):** Uses gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for cross-platform speech synthesis.

**Python Dependencies:**
- All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishanttomar21/podify-my-paper.git
cd podify-my-paper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Set up API Key(s):

You'll need API keys for:

- **Google Gemini** (Generative AI)
- **Murf AI TTS**

You can provide your API keys in one of two ways:

**Option 1: Directly edit the code (`main.py`) and replace:**

```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "Enter-your-api-key"
MURF_API_KEY = "Enter-your-murf-api-key"
```

**Option 2 (Recommended): Set the keys as environment variables in your terminal:**

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_key_here
export MURF_API_KEY=your_actual_murf_key_here
```

On **Windows**, use:

```cmd
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
set MURF_API_KEY=your_actual_murf_key_here
```

### 2. Run the App

After installation and setting the API key, start the web app with:

```bash
python main.py
```
